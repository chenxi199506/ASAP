## üåê English Summary

### üîç Overview
This project presents an **AI Agent-based systematic audit** of over **300,000 published meta-analyses**, revealing widespread **methodological deficiencies and biases** in contemporary evidence synthesis.  
It introduces three major components:  

- **MASTER Agent** ‚Äì A large language model‚Äìdriven system for automated screening, transformation, and evaluation of meta-analyses.  
- **UMAR** ‚Äì A comprehensive repository of **311,751 structured, high-quality meta-analyses** supporting large-scale, cross-disciplinary evidence exploration.  
- **ASAP** ‚Äì An Agent-based Secondary Meta-Analysis Platform enabling **real-time, scalable, and reproducible** meta-analyses through automated literature retrieval, data extraction, and visualization.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methods
Ten LLMs were benchmarked, and the top-performing model (Gemini-2.0) was used to build MASTER Agent through advanced prompt engineering.  
Using MASTER, UMAR was assembled and subsequently integrated into ASAP for multi-modal meta-analytic workflows.

### üìä Key Findings
- **25%** of existing meta-analyses were statistically **underpowered**.  
- **P-hacking** was prevalent, especially in small-sample studies.  
- **Positive-result** meta-analyses exhibited **systematically higher precision** than negative ones, revealing a new form of **precision‚Äìeffect bias**.

### üí° Conclusion
AI-driven, agent-based meta-analysis is feasible, scalable, and transformative.  
The UMAR and ASAP frameworks offer powerful tools for **automated evidence synthesis**, real-time updates, and **methodological improvement** across scientific disciplines.
